# nyg-jam3

[![stable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/stable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Jam3 project scaffold based on [nyg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyg). Used to create the basic files needed for a Jam3 project.

## Usage

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/nyg-jam3.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyg-jam3)

The nyg generator is designed to function similar to yeoman. To get it running, simply follow these steps:

```bash
npm i nyg -g
npm i nyg-jam3 -g
cd your-project-directory
nyg nyg-jam3
```

You will then be prompted with a number of questions, which will define the project. The appropriate files will then be copied to the current directory and it will install all your needed dependencies. Congratulations, you are now setup with the basis of a Jam3 project.
