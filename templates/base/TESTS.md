# Tests

Tests are set up for dev environment and you can access the list of test components in your browser at `http://localhost:9966/test`.
Each component will be available on it's own page like `http://localhost:9966/test/{componentName}`.

To add a new item to the list, add a component to the `src/tests/manifest.js` and a create a wrapper component if necessary. 
Refer to existing test examples `src/tests/`;
